## Contributing

__Warning: This section is not complete.__

Thanks for contributing. The public files here is sufficient to start up your own version of the website, along with the (soon to be) public scraper API from [diego-yason/scraper](https://github.com/diego-yason/scraper).

### Preparations

Set up your own Supabase server in their [website](https://supabase.com/). You can name it whatever you want.
While the project is setting up, the keys Supabase will give you are the keys you need to add to your `.env` file.

#### Scraper

__IMPORTANT:__ A scraper is *not* necessary for contributing to this project. There will eventually be a sample data set for you to use and import to your database for development.

As of now, scraping API is not yet available to the public. [diego-yason/scraper](https://github.com/diego-yason/scraper) to set it up yourself, if interested. You will need to change any urls that point to `scraper.12308978.xyz` to whatever domain your own version of the scraper is hosted on.

#### OAuth sign-in

### Approval

Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the `dev` branch, as a form of preview of the next version of the website.

## Thanks

Special thanks to Zel for providing the foundations for the scraper found at [diego-yason/scraper](https://github.com/diego-yason/scraper), which this project uses.
